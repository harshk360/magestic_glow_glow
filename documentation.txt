Here is an outline of functionality that we need to implement (because I'm on a windows machine, dont have root access on EWS, and the VM is running an old version of linux, so essentially nothing works.  I will get a virtual machine, but in the meantime:.)

Addressable LED Lights controlled by Memory Mapped I/O

In our C library code:

Init_Funtions:
- initialize memory-mapped arrays that correspond to the physical configuration of LEDs
	- Ex: 	Init_Array(size or whatever)
		Init_Radial(scalar or something)

Objects:
- initialize various objects and light them up in array
	- Ex: 	Coord(int x, int y, color, bool vis)
		Set(Coord[] list)
		Circle(int x, int y, int radius)
		Letter(int x, int y, int scale, char c)
		Message(Letter[] string)
		Picture(PNG png)

Mutator_Functions:
- perform mutations on objects
	- Ex: 	set.SetColor(color c) // will allow for custom images to be treated like a unit
		message.slide(int direction, int speed, bool wrap) //various sliding translations
		letter.rotate(int direction, int speed) //rotation
 		rectangle.gradient(color sequence[], int speed, int terminate) //changes rectangle to colors in sequence at set speed
		set.draw(int order[], int speed) //can initialize an image by drawing coordinates one at a time (to their set colors)
		picture.incrementColor(int speed, int direction) //increments color by some algorithm, can be used with objects with multi-colored pixels		

These are the types of things our C library for python will provide.
The user will be able to set up their LEDs in a configuration and init_Config said configuration in python. 
Then he will be able to create objects and manipulate them on the LED configuration using our convenient library.
TADA!!
